# EigenFace

This project uses the Eigenfaces method developed by Sirovich and Kirby to recognize a face from a training set of 10 students (100 images).

The program randomly selects one face out of the provided training set as the test image, and tries to find its closest match. Successful iterations will show the same person in both images displayed.

Images are not shown in repo for privacy reasons.
